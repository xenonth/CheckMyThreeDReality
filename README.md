# CheckMyThreeDReality
To learn and build a basic understanding of the three.js library.

The structure is laid out where each guide from the three.js website is a subfolder in this directory.

Starting with creating a scene.

First project was creating which is now completed.

Second Project was creating a simple shape using point locations.
This was done by creating arrays for each shape in the design, then pusing the points for the shape to draw to and calling them into the scene.

Currently, learning how to add 3d text to the scene.  

Long term:
Create a solar system based on the Sol system and have the planets rotate around a central point.

Dice rolling application.  Have a 3d dice rolling application:
have each 3d shape wrapped with a cool design.  You click a button and an internal physics engine will generate the result.  Next if possible whatever result is displayed will hopefully appear on the screen.
